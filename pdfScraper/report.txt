THE  RAMPART  AND  HOT  SPRINGS  REGIONS.

By  HENRY  M.  EAKIN.

INTRODUCTION.

The  Rampart  and  Hot  Springs  gold-placer  districts  comprise  the 
greater part of the triangular area lying between  Yukon and Tanana
rivers  west  of  longitude  150°.  The  Rampart  district  lies  north  of 
the  divide,  on  Minook  Creek  and  its  tributaries;  the  Hot  Springs 
district  includes  the  basins  of  Baker  and  Patterson  creeks,  which 
flow  directly  into  the  Tanana,  and  American  Creek,  which  flows 
into  Fish  Lake.  The  region  comprises  also  the  territory  lying 
within  a  few  miles  of  the  Yukon  as  far  west  as  longitude  154°, 
which  is  included  in  order  to  cover  the  basins  of  Grant,  Illinois, 
and  Mason  creeks,  tributaries  of  the  Yukon  from  the  north  below 
the mouth of the Tanana.

During  the  season  of  1911  the  writer  made  a  geologic  reconnais(cid:173) 
sance  of  the  region  outlined  above  and  learned  the  facts  here  pre(cid:173) 
sented.  This  report, however,  is  intended to  present only  the  results 
of  this  study  that pertain to  the  general  geology  and  mining  activi(cid:173) 
ties  of  ihe  fegion,  the  more  intricate  geologic  and  physiographic 
problems  being  left  for  treatment  in  a  more  complete  report,  now 
in  preparation,  which  will  be  accompanied  by  geologic  and  topo(cid:173) 
graphic  maps.

GEOGRAPHY.

The  Rampart-Hot  Springs  region  lies  near  the  geographic  center 
of Alaska, between  longitudes  150°  and  154°.  adjacent to  Yukon and 
Tanana rivers, which join near its center. 
(See geologic sketch map, 
PI.  XIII.)

The  drainage  of  the  region  is  all  tributary  to  the  Yukon  and 
Tanana.  The  largest  of  the  secondary  streams  is  Tozitna  River, 
perhaps  100  miles  long,  which  enters  the  Yukon  from  the  north 
about  15  miles  below  the  mouth  of  the  Tanana.  The  other  streams 
of  the  region  are  relatively  small,  the  largest  being  only  about 
20  miles long.

The  greater  part  of  the  Rampart-Hot  Springs  region  has  strong 
topographic  relief.  Elevations  of  2,000  to  4,000  feet  are  common,

and  the  valleys  are  usually  steep  sided  and  are  carried  with  low 
gradients well back into the hills, where  they head  abruptly.  In the 
lower  parts  of  the  smaller  valleys  and  along  the  larger  streams 
extensive lowlands are  developed.

The  climate  of  the  region  is  that  prevalent  in  the  interior  of 
Alaska,  being  semiarid -and  marked  by  great  seasonal  variations  in 
temperature.  Continuous  observations  for  a  year  at  Rampart  and 
supplementary  records  for  shorter  periods  indicate  an  annual  pre(cid:173) 
cipitation  of  11.96  inches.  A  longer  period  of  observation  might 
alter this figure somewhat, but not enough to show  more than a very 
scanty  rainfall.

The  annual temperatures of the region are summarized by  Brooks 1 
in  a  recent  report.  Concerning  the  interior  province  of  Alaska, 
which  includes  the  area  under  discussion,  he  says:  " The  average 
winter temperature in this province is  5° to  10°, with a minimum" 
of   65°  to   76°.  For  the  summer  months  of  June,  July,  and 
August  the  mean  is  50°  to  60°  and  the  recorded  maximum  90°."

The  open  season  in  the  Rampart-Hot  Springs  region  commences 
between  the  1st  and  the  10th  of  May  and  ends  between  the  1st  and 
the  15th  of  October.

Timber  suitable  for  fuel  and  some  suitable  for  lumber  grows  in 
all  the  valleys  of  the  region.  Spruce  is  the  most  important  kind, 
being more  widely  distributed  than  any  other  and  in. places  supply(cid:173) 
ing  logs  that  measure  more  than  2  feet  in  diameter.  Cottonwood 
and  birch  are  also  valuable,  especially  near -Hot  Springs,  where  the 
trees  are  unusually  large.  A  few  tamarack  were  noted  on  some  of 
the  Yukon  tributaries,  and  willow  and  scrub  alder  thrive  beside  the 
streams  and  on  the  higher  slopes.  Probably  four-fifths  of  the  tim(cid:173) 
bered  areas have been burned over in the last  decade,  and the supply
has been correspondingly reduced.

Agricultural  products,  including  the  ordinary  vegetables  and  a 
variety  of grains,  are  grown  successfully.  The  Government  agricul(cid:173) 
tural  station  at  Rampart  is  experimenting  with these products with 
encouraging results.

The  mining  districts  support  several  small  settlements.  Rampart 
on  the  Yukon  and  Hot  Springs  on  a  slough  of  the  Tanana  supply 
merchandise  and  business  facilities  to  their  respective  districts. 
There  are  two  other  settlements  in  the  Hot  Springs  district Tofty 
on  Sullivan  Creek  and  Glen  on  a tributary  of Baker  Creek.  A  few 
cabins  and  road  houses  are  grouped  on  the  bank  of the  Yukon  near 
the  mouth  of  Grant  Creek,  of  the  Gold  Mountain  district.  The 
largest  settlement  of  the  region  is  Tanana,  on  the  right bank  of the 
Yukon  near the  mouth of Tanana River.  It is  the  connecting point

TRANSPORTATION.

Easy  access  to  all  parts  of  the  region  is  afforded  by  Yukon  and 
Tanana rivers, which are navigated by a fleet of well-equipped steam(cid:173) 
boats  during  the  open  season,  usually  from  early  June  to  the  last 
of  September.  The  freight rates  from  Seattle  depend  on  the  nature 
of  the  commodity  and  the  routing,  as  indicated  in  the  following

Local  freight rates  from  river points  to  the  creeks  vary  with road 
conditions  and  the  seasons  of  the  year.  In  both  the  Rampart  and 
Hot  Springs  districts  some  excellent  roads  are  maintained.  The 
rapid  development of the  Sullivan  Creek  placers within  the last two 
years has demanded additional road improvements, which were being 
pushed during the summer of 1911.  The summer rate on goods from 
Hot  Springs  to  Tofty,  a  distance  of  12  miles,  was  5  cents  a  pound, 
and  considering  the  difficulties  of  the  journey  this  charge  was  not 
unreasonable.  When  the  road  now  under  construction  is  completed 
the summer rate will probably be reduced to about the present winter 
rate,  1^  cents  a  pound.

All the river communities are in touch with the United States mili(cid:173) 
tary telegraph, the lines of which  are shown  on the map  (PL  XIII). 
Local  telegraph  lines  give  service  in  the  Rampart  and  Hot  Springs 
districts.  Regular  United  States  mail  service  extends  to  all the  set(cid:173) 
tlements  in  both  winter  and  summer.

Labor  was  plentiful  during  the  summer  of  1911,  wages  being  $5 
a  day  and  board.  This  amounts  to  a  total  expense  of  about  $6.50 
a day  for each  man.

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OF  ALASKA,  1911.

GENERAL  GEOLOGY.

OUTLINE.

The  base  of  the  geologic  column  in  the  Kampart-Hot  Springs 
region  is  represented  by  a  series  of  metamorphic  rocks.  Although 
mainly  of  sedimentary  origin,  igneous  flows  are  common  in  some 
of  its  members,  and  locally  it  contains  granitic  intrusives.  Differ(cid:173) 
ences  in  original  constitution  and  in  degrees  of  alteration  have 
resulted  in  wide  divergence  between  the  rock  types  included  in  the 
series.  It  is  probably  in  the main  of  Paleozoic  age,  but  it  may  also 
include Mesozoic beds.  The metamorphic series is overlain locally by 
Tertiary  beds  and  broadly  by  those  of  Quaternary  age.  Granitic 
intrusives  are  distributed widely through the region in small,  discon(cid:173) 
tinuous  areas.  They  are  accompanied by  a  complex  system of  dikes, 
which  are probably  related  to  them  genetically.

METAMORPHIC  SERIES.

The  metamorphic  series  can  be  arranged  in  four  lithologic  divi(cid:173) 
sions,  each  division  including  a  different  group  of  rock  types  that 
are  constantly  associated  over  a  considerable  area.  The  areas  occu(cid:173) 
pied by  the several groups are  distinguished on the map  (PL  XIII).
The  northernmost  area  of  the  other  rocks  is  occupied  by  a  group 
of  greenstones,  derived  from  ultrabasic  flows  and  tuffs  that  are 
mainly of a  diabasic character.  With these basic rocks  are  associated 
considerable  areas  of  rhyolite  and  a  smaller  quantity  of  slate,  chert, 
and  impure  limestone.

South  of  the  greenstone  area,  between  Yukon  and  Tanana  rivers 
and the Gold  Mountain  district,  are  areas  occupied  by  a more highly 
metamorphosed  group  characterized  by  an  abundance  of  crystalline 
limestone  and  a  variety  of  schists.  The  latter  are  mainly  quartzite 
schists, but include  also  quartz-mica schists,  garnet  schist,  greenstone 
schist,  and  calcareous,  graphitic,  and  feldspathic  schists.  The green(cid:173) 
stone  and  feldspathic  schists  grade  into  less  metamorphosed  types 
that  are  clearly  of  igneous  origin.  Some  of  the  quartzose  schists 
are  apparently  sheared  cherty  rocks,  which  were  developed  through 
replacement  of  original  limestones.  The  micaceous  and  garnetifer- 
ous  schists  are  associated  with  permatite  dikes  and  quartz  veins  and 
comprise  only  a  small  part  of  the mass  of  the group.

From  the  foregoing  description  it  is  apparent  that  the  limestone 
and  schist  groups  have  suffered  both  regional  and  contact  meta- 
morphism,  and  that,  so  far  as 1  their  physical  condition  indicates, 
they are older than the greenstones  and the other groups that remain 
to  be  described.

The  third  area  of  metamorphic  rocks  includes  most  of  the  Hot 
Springs  district  and  reaches  northeastward  beyond  the  limits  of 
the  quadrangle.  It is  occupied  by  phyllites,  quartzites,  and  schists

RAMPART  AND  HOT  SPRINGS  REGION.

less altered than the limestone-schist group  and  apparently overlying 
them.

South  of  the  last  area  and  occupying  the  big  bend  of  Tanana 
Eiver  southeast  of  Baker  Flat  is  the  fourth  group  of  the  meta- 
morphic rocks,  which  includes  highly  contorted  red  arid  green  slates, 
sandstones,  and  fine  conglomerates.1

TERTIARY  SEDIMENTS.

Several  small  isolated  areas  of  Tertiary  sediments  occur  in  the 
region  adjacent  to  Yukon  River.  These  rocks  rest  unconformably 
upon  the  various  members  of  the  older  formations  and  yield  fossil 
plants and invertebrates of Eocene age.

QUATERNARY  SEDIMENTS.

Uncpnsolidated silts  and gravels mantle much of the region.  The
former  are  believed  to  be  mainly  of  lacustrine  origin  and  they  are 
assigned  provisionally to the Pleistocene epoch.  The gravel  deposits 
are  of two  types a widespread  deposit  of  variable  thickness  under(cid:173) 
lying the silts,  and the fluviatile  deposits  of the modern  flood  plains. 
All of the unconsolidated  sediments  of the region have been  included 
under  the  same  pattern  in  mapping.

IGNEOUS  ROCKS.

The  oldest  igneous  rocks  of the  region  are  probably  the flows  and 

tuffs  of  the  metamorphic  series  now  altered  to  greenstones.

Prior to  the  principal  deformation  of  the  metamorphic  series,  ex(cid:173) 
tensive  intrusions  of  granite  occurred  in  the  Gold  Mountain  region 
and  farther west.  These  intrusions  are  now  represented  by  gneisses 
and  feldspathic  schists  in  the  prominent  range  of  mountains  that 
extends  southwestward  along  the  Yukon  from  a  point  near  the 
head  of Mason  Creek.

At  a  much  later  period  (late  Mesozoic  or  early  Tertiary)  exten(cid:173) 
sive  intrusions  of  granite  occurred  in  discontinuous  areas  widely 
scattered  oyer  the  region,  accompanied  by  the  formation  of  an 
elaborate  system  of  dikes,  ranging  in  composition  from  granites, 
aplites,  and  acid  pegmatites  to gabbros  and  diorites.

ECONOMIC  GEOLOGY.

IMPORTANT  MINERALS.

Gold  is  the  only  mineral  whose  occurrence  in  the  Rampart-Hot 
Springs  region  has  proved  to  be  of  economic  importance.  It  has 
been  mined  profitably in  both the Rampart and the Hot Springs dis(cid:173) 
tricts and is known to occur at a  number of other localities.

Tin occurs with the gold in the placers of Sullivan Creek, and small 
quantities  have  been  recovered  incidentally  to  the  gold  mining.  So 
far, however,  no  serious  attempt has  been  made  to  recover  any  large 
part of the tin ore,  and  only  a  small quantity  has been  shipped.

Lignitic coal occurs in the Eocene beds near Rampart, but no seams 

thick  enough  for profitable mining have  been  found.

GOLD. 

HISTORY  OF  PROSPECTING  AND  MINING.

Placer  gold  was  discovered  in  the  Rampart  quadrangle  probably 
as  early  as  1893.  The  first  discoveries  were  made  on  Minook  Creek 
and  its  tributaries,  and  since  1896  systematic  mining  has  been  done 
in this district.  Later, as the area being prospected increased, rplacers 
were  located  and  mines  developed  on  the tributaries  of  Baker  Creek 
along  the  northern  border  of  the  flats,  and  still  later  on  Sullivan 
Creek  and neighboring streams tributary to  Patterson Creek.

Prospecting  on  the  tributaries  of  the  Yukon  and  Tanana  west  of 
the  productive  areas  has  revealed  the  presence  of  gold  at  several 
places. 
(See  map,  PI.  XIII).  Although  much  ground  is  held  on 
some  of  these  streams,  especially  in  the  Gold  Mountain  region,  the 
presence of gold in commercial quantities has not been  demonstrated. 
In  the  Gold  Mountain  region  this  may  be  largely  due  to  the  facts 
that very little beyond annual assessment work is being done and that 
this work is largely of a futile character.

The scene of greatest activity in mining in the Rampart quadrangle 
has shifted southward with successive discoveries.  The Rampart dis(cid:173) 
trict yielded  its greatest output in  1906  and  1907.  The  placers along 
the north margin  of Baker  Flats reached  their maximum  production 
about  the  same  time  but  have  not  fallen  off  so  rapidly  since.  The 
Patterson  Creek  locality  has  steadily  increased  its  production  since 
operations  were  begun,  the  season  of  1911  recording the largest  out(cid:173) 
put in its history.

SOURCE  OF  THE  GOLD.

The  distribution  of  the  gold  in  the  Rampart-Hot  Springs  region 
is  definitely  related  to  the  metamorphic  rocks.  The  bedrock  in  the 
Rampart  district  is  the  lower  part  of  the  greenstone  group,  which 
includes  besides  greenstones  a  variety  of  more  or  less  entered  slates,
cherts,  and  impure  limestones.  The  Hot  Springs  district,  from 
American  Creek  to  the  Baker  Creek  placers,  lies  within  the  slate- 
quartzite-schist  area,  and  the  placer  ground  of  Quail  Creek,  which 
heads against Little Minook Creek, is  a continuation of the same  area.
Quartz  veins  are  so  plentifully  distributed  in  the  older  rocks  of 
the  entire  region  that  a  greater  abundance  in  the  areas  yielding  the 
placers  can  hardly  be  asserted.  But  although  as  a  rule  the  quartz 
veins are barren  of visible mineralization,  there is  some  evidence that 
in  the  placer  districts  they  are  gold  bearing. 
'On  Little  Minook  a 
vein  6  feet  wide  is  said  to  yield  gold  on  being  crushed  and  panned. 
In  the  Sullivan  Creek  placers  the  richer  ground  is  thought  by  the 
operators to be marked by  an unusual abundance of quartz veins.  In 
both  districts  nuggets  composed  partly  of  quartz  are  common. 
In 
the  Gold  Mountain  district is  a  quartz  vein  known  to  be  auriferous, 
but  an  unsuccessful  attempt  has  proved  that  it  is  not  of  sufficient 
extent or richness  to be  mined  profitably.

Although  there  is  evidence  that  much  of  the  placer  gold  comes 
from  quartz veins,  another source is suggested  for a part of it at least 
in the Hot Springs region.  Nuggets from What Cheer Bar near Glen 
include fragments  of black slate.  The tailings of one of the Sullivan 
Creek  mines  contained  a  piece  of  quartzite  having  tiny  stringers  of 
gold  running  along  its  cleavage  planes.  On  these  creeks  it  would 
appear  that  the  gold  was  deposited  in  the  available  spaces  in  the 
country rock, wholly without gangue minerals.  The formations com(cid:173) 
prising the  country  rock  in  all  the  placer  districts  contain  members 
that  are  very  rich  in  carbonaceous  material.  Carbon  is  believed  to 
influence  the  precipitation  of  gold  under  certain  conditions,  and  it 
seems  possible  that  the  distribution  of  gold  in  the  region  may  be 
related in some  degree to that of the carbonaceous beds.  

278 

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OF  ALASKA,  1911.

Still  another  source  of  gold  may  be  the  hematite  deposits  in  the 
neighborhood  of  the  granite  areas  near  Hot  Springs  and  Roughtop 
Mountain.  Brecciated zones of the country rock ranging from a few 
inches  to  several  feet  in  width  have  received  deposits  of  hematite. 
Samples  taken  from  these  deposits  in both localities are said to yield 
steady  assay  returns  of  several  dollars  a  ton  in  gold.  Although  this 
is  an unusual mode of occurrence for gold, the hematite deposits may 
possibly  be  auriferous,  but  further  sampling,  including  entire  cross(cid:173) 
cuts  of  minable  bodies  of  the  ore,  will  be  required  before  their 
economic  value  will  be  established.

AURIFEROUS  GRAVELS.

The auriferous gravel deposits of the Rampart-Hot Springs region, 
considered in their relation to modern topography, are of two types- 
stream gravels,  forming the beds  and flood  plains  of modern streams, 
and terrace gravels, situated above the present valley floors.  Some of 
the terrace gravels cover benches that undoubtedly,owe their origin to 
the  present streams, but the relation  of others to  streams is doubtful.

STREAM  GRAVELS.

The stream gravels have yielded the greater part of the production 
of the Rampart district, the operations on all the creeks except Hunter 
being  confined  to  them.  On  Hunter  Creek  only  a  small  part  of  the 
production  has  come-  from  this  source.  The  stream  gravels  of  the 
district  are shallow  as  a  rule;  on  Minook  Creek  they  are  from  a  few 
feet  to  15  or  20  feet  thick,  and  on  the  smaller  streams  the  range  is 
even  less,  the  usual  thickness  being  about  6  or  8  feet.  The  gravels 
are  usually  covered  with  a  deposit  of  muck  and  silt,  which  thickens 
as the sides of the valley are approached.  It appears that the valleys 
were  at  one time more  or  less  completely filled  with  silt,  a  large  part
of  which  has  since  been  removed.  Near  the  courses  of  the  streams, 
where  the  removal  has  been  most  complete,  open-cut  methods  are 
employed;  but  nearer  the  valley  walls,  where  the  overburden  is  very 
heavy,  drifting becomes necessary.

In  the  Hot  Springs  district  a  large  part  of  the  production  from 
the  streams  tributary  to  Baker  Creek  has  come  from  the  stream 
gravels.  The  deposits  of  this  type  are  similar  to  those  of the  Ram(cid:173) 
part  district,  except  that  they  are  generally  overlain  by  a  much 
thinner  overburden of  silt or  muck.  The stream  gravels of the Pat- 
terson  Creek  group  have  not  been  productive.  They  carry  gold  in 
small quantities,  but  are nowhere rich enough to be mined profitably.

TERRACE  GRAVELS.

Terrace  gravels  occur  in  both  the  Rampart  and  the  Hot  Springs 
district.  In  the  Rampart  district  well-defined  benches  occur  on 
Minook  and Hunter creeks.

RAMPART  AND  HOT  SPRINGS  EEGION. 

279

The Hunter Creek benches lie  along the valley walls  and may  rep(cid:173) 
resent  stages  in  the  downcutting  of  the  stream.  The  lowest  bench 
is  only  15  or  20  feet  above  the  stream,  as  a  rule,  and  has  been  the 
principal  source  of  the  gold.  Its  bedrock  surface  is  irregular,  in 
some  places  sloping  downward  away  from  the  stream,  toward  the 
valley  wall.  The  actual  surface  always  slopes  upward  toward  the 
margin  of  the  valley,  this  being  especially  noticeable  in  the  vicinity 
of  lateral  streams.  The  upper  part  of .this  bench  deposit  seems  to 
be  composed  largely  of  materials  delivered  to  the  main  valley  by  its 
tributaries  in  the  form  of  alluvial  fans  of  varying  steepness.  The 
deposits  of the  lower  terrace of Hunter  Creek  are  minable by  open- 
cut  methods  along  their  streamward  margins,  being  made  up,  as  a 
rule,  of 3  to 6  feet  of gravel,  with  a  few  feet  of muck  as  overburden. 
The notable thickening of the  overburden toward the margins of  the 
valley  limits the  extent  to which  such  methods  are  applicable.

Rather  indefinite  remnants  of  terraces  occur  at various  elevations 
along  the  sides  of  Minook  Valley,  but  only  the  lower  bench,  which 
resembles  that of Hunter Creek,  has been  productive.

The  ridges  between  the  eastern  tributaries  of  Minook  Creek  are 
peculiarly  flat-topped  and  rise  in  a  succession  of  broad  steps  to  the 
eastward  from  600  to  800  feet  above  the level  of  Minook  Creek.  In 
part they  carry  gravel  deposits  that have proved,  locally  at least,  to 
be  gold  bearing.  Prospecting  has  revealed  various  depths  of  the 
deposits  at  different  places,  the  greatest  being  more  than  100  feet. 
The materials of most of them include fragments of the local country 
rock, more  or less  worn,  yellow  clays  or  silts,  and  scattered  quartzite 
bowlders,  some  of  great  size,  which  are  foreign  to  the  immediate 
neighborhood.  Only  very  low  values  have  been  reported  from these 
deposits,  and  their  elevated  position,  even  if  they  should  prove  to 
contain larger  amounts of gold,  would render their exploitation  very 
difficult.

In  the  Hot  Springs  district  bench  gravels  have  been  productive 
on  most  of  the  gold-bearing  streams  tributary  to  Baker  Creek,  and 
practically all of the Patterson Creek placers are in deposits that have 
no  evident relation to the  present  streams.

The  peculiar  type  of  bench  deposits  characteristic  of  the  Hot 
Springs  district  is  illustrated  by  What  Cheer  Bar.  This  deposit 
skirts  the  point  between  Eureka  and  Pioneer  creeks,  about  250  feet 
above  and 2,000  feet up  the side  of the valley  from the latter stream. 
A  space  2,000  feet  long  and  from  150  to  200  feet  wide  has  been 
mined  and  the  resulting  cut  reveals  the  general  character  of  the 
deposit.  What  Cheer  Bar  is  a  flattened  space  on  a  gently  sloping 
valley side,  which  formerly bore auriferous gravels ranging in depth 
from  3  to  10  feet.  The  gravels  range  in  size  from  fine  material  up 
to bowlders several  feet in diameter.  In its long direction the bench

280 

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OP  ALASKA,  1911.

has  no  perceptible  grade,  but  crosswise,  in  the  direction  of  Pioneer 
Creek,  it  slopes  at  a  grade  which  was  found  suitable  for  the  sluice 
boxes  but  which  is  less  than  the  general  slope  of  the  hillside.  At 
the  uphill  side  of  the  bench  the  bedrock  rises  at  a  steeper  angle 
nearly  to  the  surface  and  then  flattens  to  the  general  slope  of  the 
hillside.  The  bowlders  found  in  the  deposit  are  mostly  of  quartzite 
with  some  conglomerate,  both  known  to  occur  within  the  basin 
of  Pioneer  Creek  and  perhaps  in  the  hill  on  which  the  bench  is 
developed.  Other  benches  that  carry  a  little  gold  occur  o"h  the  hill(cid:173) 
side  above  What  Cheer  Bar,  and  farther  up  the  valley  of  Pioneer 
Creek  on  the same hillside  similar  deposits have been  productive.

A  heavy  deposit  of  gravel  occurs  along  the  north  side  of  Baker 
Flats'west of Eureka Creek,  apparently unrelated  in its origin to the 
present,  streams,  which  flow  transversely  across  it.  Although,  as  a 
rule,  this  deposit  has  proved  of  too  low  a  tenor  to  be  worked,  it 
carries  some  gold  and  probably  has  been  the  source  of  much  of  the 
gold  found in the gravels of the streams where they  cross  it.

In  the  Patterson  Creek  locality  shallow  gravels  are  worked  by 
open-cut  methods  on  Quartz  Creek  and  Tofty  Gulch.  The  deposit 
on  Quartz  Creek,  known  as  Homestake  Bar,  is  about  a  quarter  of 
a  mile  from  the creek  on  a slightly sloping hillside.  It consists  of  3 
or 4  feet of gravels overlain by 3  feet, of yellow  silt.  The gravels are 
little  worn,  except  a  thickness  of  about  1  foot  next  to  bedrock. 
The  entire  hillside  is  covered  with  deposits  similar  to  those  being 
worked  except  that  they  carry  less  gold.  The  workable  deposit  ex(cid:173) 
tends  horizontally  along  the  hillside,  and  there  are  no  surface  indi(cid:173) 
cations  to  show  its  extent.  However,  the  bedrock  slopes  at  a  lower 
angle  toward  the  creek  than  the  surface  of  the  ground,  and  at  the 
uphill  margin  it  rises  more  sharply,  forming  a  so-called  " rim." 
The  " rim "  seems  to  mark  the  limit  of  the  richer  deposit.  The 
ground  is  worked  by  groundsluicing  and  pick-and-shovel  methods.
On Tofty  Gulch  a  considerable open  cut has been made on  a  bench 
on  the  hillside  about  1,000  feet  from  Sullivan  Creek.  The  deposit 
consisted  of  4  to  6  feet  of  gravel  covered  by  several  feet  of  yellow 
silt  and  black  muck.  Large  bowlders  were  very  common  in  the  top. 
layers  of  the  gravel,  some  being  found  in  the  lower part of the  silt. 
The black muck contained a great quantity of remains of trees, which 
added  considerably  to  the  difficulty  and  expense  of  mining.  In 
working  the  deposit  the  top  layers  of  muck  and  silt  were  ground- 
sluiced  off,  dynamite being employed to break up the tangle of wood 
debris  in  places,  after  which  the  gravels  were  carried  to  the  sluice 
boxes  with  a  steam  scraper.

The  other  placers  of  Sullivan  Creek  and  those  of  Cache  Creek  are 
deeper, being from 30 to  75  feet below  the surface.  They are worked 
by  drifting,  machinery  being  employed  to  hoist  the  gravel  to  the

BAMPAIIT  AND  HOT  SPRINGS  REGION. 

281

surface.  The  thickness  of  the  gravel  deposits  ranges  from  10  to  35 
feet,  the  remaining  depth  being  made  up  by  an  overburden  of  silt. 
At  one  place  between  Cache  and  Sullivan  creeks  a  thickness  of  90 
feet  of silt is  said to have been penetrated in sinking an unsuccessful 
prospecting  shaft.  The  gravels  include  some  well-worn  materials, 
but are mostly made up of angular fragments of the country rock.  In 
fact,  it  is  often  difficult  to  distinguish  the  surface  of  the  bedrock 
because  it  is  so  closely  resembled  by  the  fragmental  deposits.  One 
prospect  hole  was  abandoned  on  reaching  a  lens  of  these  deposits, 
but  when  deeper  holes  revealed  rich  gravels  near  by,  the  shaft  was 
sunk  deeper,  and  on  reaching  the  true  bedrock  workable  gravels 
were  found.

The  better  worn  materials  are  usually  of  the most  resistant types, 
a  hard  vitreous  quartzite  being  common.  Many  bowlders  of  this 
type,  too  large  to  handle,  are  encountered  in  all  the  drifts;  in  some 
5-foot  drifts  all  the  vertical  space  is  taken  up  by  a  single  bowlder. 
However,  as  these bowlders  are .generally  more  or  less  isolated,  they 
present no  serious  difficulty to  the miner.

Most of the bedrock  surface is  considerably weathered,  being brec(cid:173) 
cia ted  and carrying gold  to a  depth  of  a  foot  or more.  The bedrock 
in  all  the  deeper  mines  has  the  form  of  a  succession  of  flat  benches 
that  rise  one  after  another  toward  the  higher  ground.  The .richest 
gravels  are  commonly  found  near  the  uphill  margin  of  the  benches.
The  auriferous  gravels  of  American  Creek  are  somewhat  similar 
to  the  bench  gravels  of  the  Patterson  Creek  locality.  The  later 
discoveries  are  reported  to  be  on  bench  ground  rather  than  in  the 
stream  gravels.  The  depths  range  from  10  to  20  feet.  The gravels 
are  worked by  drifting, and so far no steam machinery has been  used 
in hoisting.

On  Grant  Creek  and  some  of its  tributaries  and  on  Illinois  Creek, 
in  the  Gold  Mountain  district,  good  prospects  are  reported  to  have 
been  found,  but  so  far  no  valuable  deposits  have  been  discovered. 
Prospecting  is  seriously  hindered  by  the  great  depth  of  the  gravels 
in  much  of  the  district  and  by  live  water  where  they  are  thawed. 
On  Illinois  Creek  a  hole  is  said  to  have been  sunk  133  feet  and  then 
abandoned,  on account of live water, without having reached bedrock. 
The  hole  is  said  to  have  penetrated  several  beds  containing  a  little 
fine  gold.

On  Grant  Creek  the  results  have .been  much  the  same,  holes  sunk 
from  30  to 135  feet having been  abandoned  on  account  of live  water. 
The  only  holes  sunk  to  bedrock  on  Grant  Creek  are  about  2|  miles 
above  its mouth  and  are  about  30  feet  deep.  A  few  holes  about  20 
feet deep have been  driven on Lynx  Creek, the principal eastern trib(cid:173) 
utary  of  Grant,  discovering  a  foot  of  gravel  on  bedrock,  which  is 
said  to  have  yielded  at the  rate  of $10  or  $12  a  yard.  After  a  little

282 

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OF  ALASKA,  1911.

drifting  had  been  done  the  works  were  abandoned.  On  American 
Gulch,  a  small  tributary  of  Grant  Creek  near  its  head,  the  gravels 
are said to yield the best prospects found in the region, some estimates 
putting  the  values  as  high  as  $1  a  square  foot  of  bedrock.  The 
gravels  are  10  to  12  feet  deep  and  are  thawed.  The  construction  of 
a  bedrock  drain,  which  has  been  unsuccessfully  attempted,  would 
doubtless permit more  definite knowledge of the deposit to be gained.

WATER  SUPPLY.

With  the  exception  of  Minook  Creek  and  its  tributaries,  Hunter 
and  Hoosier  creeks^  the 1  streams  of  the  Rampart  and  Hot  Springs 
districts  afford  a  very  scanty  supply  of  water  for  mining.  Hunter 
Creek  usually  furnishes  water sufficient  for two  3-inch  nozzles  under 
a  150-foot  head;  and  in  time  of  freshets,  of  course,  the  discharge  is 
much  greater. 
Its  recorded  minimum  flow 1  is  3.7  second-feet,  or 
about  150  miners'  inches,  and  its  maximum;  27  second-feet,  or more 
than  1,000  miners'  inches.  Hoosier  Creek  is  very  nearly  the  same 
size.  Little Minook Creek carries less than a  sluicehead  during much 
of the drier part  of the season.

Eureka Creek at its mouth has a discharge similar to that of Hunter 
Creek.  About  half  of  this  is  contributed  by  Pioneer  Creek  and 
about  a  fourth by  the main head  of Eureka  above  Pioneer.  None  of 
the  tributaries  of  Patterson  Creek  at  the  locality  of  the  mines  fur(cid:173) 
nishes  sufficient water  for constant  sluicing during much  of the  sum(cid:173) 
mer,  and pumping is commonly  resorted to at most of the plants.

MINING. 

RAMPART  DISTRICT.

General statement. Active mining in the Rampart district during
1911  was  limited  to  Hunter  and  Little  Minook  creeks  of  the  Big1 
Minook  basin  and  Quail  Creek,  a  tributary  of  Troublesome  Creek. 
In general,  a  lower tenor of gravels  was  encountered  than  in  former 
years, and the difficulties experienced in exploiting them were'greater 
owing  to  an  increase  of  the  overburden  as  the  valley  walls  were 
approached  and  to  obstruction  to  the  disposal  of  tailings  due  to 
former  operations.

Hunter  Creek. On  Hunter  Creek  two  hydraulic  plants  were 
operated  during the summer of 1911.  A steam  hoist was installed on 
Dawson  Creek,  a tributary  of Hunter, but  owing to an  accident  was 
abandoned  for  the  summer.  A  single  claim  was  worked  in  a  small

way  with  pick  and  shovel.  About  12  men  were  employed  on  four 
claims a  part of the summer.

Little  Minook  Greek. On  Little  Minook  Creek  five  claims  were 
worked  to  some  extent  during  the  year.  The  operations  included 
winter drifting on two claims,  and the use of two splash dams during 
the  summer  employing  about 7  men.

Quail  Creek. This  creek  was  not  visited  by  the  writer.  It  was 
learned^  however,  from  the  miners  near  Rampart  that  four  splash 
dams  were  operated  most  of  the  summer,  employing  from  8  to  12 
men  at  different  times.

HOT  SPRINGS  DISTRICT.

General statement. The year 1911  witnessed  a  marked  decrease  in 
mining  operations  in  the  part  of  the  Hot  Springs  district  tributary 
to Baker Creek contrasted with an increased activity in the Patterson 
Creek  camp.  In the  former locality  Thanksgiving,  Omega,  Pioneer, 
Eureka, and Hutlinana creeks were active.  In the latter mining was 
in progress on  Sullivan, Cache, Quartz, and American creeks.

Thanksgiving  Greek. In  the  early  summer  about  20  men  were 
employed on Thanksgiving Creek at groundsluicing and shoveling in. 
Later  in  the  season  operations  were  at  a.standstill  owing  to lack  of 
water.

Omega  Greek. A single  claim  is reported to have been  worked on 
Omega  Creek  in  1911,  drifting  and  hoisting  being  done  by  hand. 
The  ground  was  about  16  feet  deep,  and  the  results  were  said  to  be 
satisfactory. 

°

Eureka  Greek. A  steam  scraper  was  employed  in  open-cut  work 
on  Eureka  Creek  near  the  mouth  of  Boston  Creek.  On  the  upper 
part of Eureka a claim was worked by means of a splash dam.  Eight 
or 10  men  were  employed  on this creek.

Pioneer  Greek. Four  men  were  employed  at  shoveling  in  on  the 
bench  ground  of  What  Cheer  Bar,  on  the  right  limit of  Pioneer,  a 
little  above  its  mouth.  Two  or  three  claims  were  being  worked 
higher up  on  Pioneer, but were not visited.  About 15  men were said 
to be employed in the summer workings  on  Pioneer.

Hutlinana  Greek. Four  men  operated  two  splash-dam  outfits  on 
the  upper  part  of  Hutlinana  Creek  during  the  summer.  Nothing 
definite  was  learned  of their success.

8ullivan  Greek. The  greatest activity in the whole region was in 
the  Sullivan  Creek  locality.  Six  steam  hoists,  employing  about  150 
men,  were  in  operation  most  of  the  summer.  The  claims  range  in 
depth  to  bedrock  from  30  to  TO  feet,  most  of  the  overburden  being 
yellow  silt  and the rest gravel  and black muck.
>  The gold  is  usually  in  the bottom  2  or  3  feet  of  gravel  and  in the 
shattered  bedrock.  The  tenor  of  the  gravels  expressed  in  terms  of

284 

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OF  ALASKA,  1911.

the area  of bedrock uncovered  ran from about  50  cents  a  square foot 
to  more  than $20.  Selected  pans  from  the pay  streak  of  the  richest 
claim  are  reported  to  have  carried  $10  to  $15  in  gold.  The  tenor 
of  the  gravels  actually  removed  ranged  from  about  $3.50  a  yard  to 
very  much  higher  figures,  as  may  be  inferred  from  the  rich  pans 
described  above. 

.

The  costs  of  mining  vary  with  conditions  on  the  different  claims 
and  the management employed.  Many  of the plants were compelled 
to  pump  water  for  sluicing,  which  adds  considerably  to  the expense 
for  fuel  and  cost  of  upkeep.  The  lowest  estimate  of  the  cost  of 
operation was  35  cents  a  square  foot  of  bedrock,  which  is  equivalent 
to  about  $2.50  a  yard  of  gravel.  Under  some  conditions  the  costs 
were  probably  double  this  amount.

Valuable  gravels  were  discovered  during  the  summer  on  a  claim 
adjacent  to  those  being  worked  and  further  prospecting  will  very 
likely  disclose  a  still  wider  distribution  of pay  in  this  locality.

Cache  Creek. Three  steam  hoists  were  operated  on  Cache  Creek 
in the early  part  of the  summer,  but at the  time  of the  writer's  visit 
two  had  shut  down.  The  third  plant was  employing  about  25  men, 
but  had  only  a  small  amount  of  ground  remaining  to  be  worked. 
The general mining conditions are similar to those of Sullivan Creek, 
the  pay  gravel  being  at  a  depth  of  50  feet  and  the  water  supply 
requiring the use  of the pump  for sluicing.

Quartz  Creek. A  single  plant  was  operating  on  Quartz  Creek 
The  ground  is  on  a  bench  on  the  right  limit  of  the  creek  and  is 
shallow,  allowing  the  use  of  open-cut-  methods.  A  large  area  had 
been  stripped  by  groundsluicing  off  a  covering  of  moss  and  about  3 
feet  of  muck,  and  two  men  were  shoveling  in.  The  gravel  deposit 
is  from  1  to  2  feet  deep  and  consists  mostly  of  angular,  little-worn 
material,  except  very  near  bedrock.  Although  the  entire  waters
of  the  creek  were  diverted  into  the  ditch  they  were  sufficient  for 
sluicing  less  than  half  the  time.  There  is  said  to  be  much  ground 
along this bench  which  could  be profitably worked  if sufficient  water 
could  be  had  for hydraulic mining,  but which  can  not be  worked  by 
the  more  expensive  hand  methods.

American  Greek. Discoveries  of  placer  gold  on  American  Creek, 
a  small  stream,flowing  into  Fish  Lake  about  15  miles  west  of  the 
Patterson  Creek  mines,  were  reported  early  in  1911.  Active  pros(cid:173) 
pecting during the summer located pay gravel on at least four claims, 
from  one  of  which  a  considerable  production  is  reported.  A  hand 
windlass  was  used  in  hoisting  the  gravel,  the  ground  being  only  12 
or 15  feet deep  on most  of the claims.  Thirty to  50 men were on the 
creek  most  of  the  summer  and  preparation  was  being  made  for  ex(cid:173) 
tensive  work  in  both  prospecting  and  mining  during  the  winter.

RAMPART  AND  HOT  SPRINGS  REGION. 

285 

TIN.

Smoothly  rounded pebbles  of  cassiterite,  the oxide  of tin,  occur  in 
the  placers  of  the  Sullivan  Creek  group  in  company  with  the  gold. 
The  neighboring  placers  on  Cache  and  Quartz  creeks  are  barren  of 
the  mineral,  so  that  the  area  in  which  it  occurs  is  small,  being  less 
than a mile in its longest direction.  In quantity, the tinstone or stream 
tin,  as  it  is  commonly  called,  varies  with  the  gold,  the  placers  com(cid:173) 
monly  being  rich  or  lean  in  both  minerals.  In  the  richest  spots  as 
much  as  half  a  pound  of  tin  to  the  pan  is  reported,  which  at  the 
present price of the  ore  would  give  the gravels  a  value,  not  allowing 
for costs of mining or transportation,  of $18  to $20  a yard,  according 
to  assay.

Gravels that contain  as little as  9  pounds of cassiterite to  the yard 
are  being  profitably  mined  in  the  York  region,  Alaska.  There  can 
be  little  doubt .that  a  great,  part  of  the  gravels  mined  on  Sullivan
Creek  carry  as  high  a  content  of  tin  and  that  some  may  run  much 
higher.  But  on  account  of  the  inconvenience  that  the  presence  of 
the  tin  ore  occasions  in  the  separation  of  the  gold  it  is  deemed  a 
nuisance by the miners of the district rather than a  possible  resource. 
The bedrock source  of the tin has been  the  subject  of  a  great  deal 
of  speculation,  and  considerable  effort  has  been  spent  in  trying  to 
locate it.  The search has been made  in the region  around Roughtop 
Mountain  rather  than  the  neighborhood  of  the  placers,  under  the 
impression  that  only  an  area  of  igneous  rock  could  supply  the  min(cid:173) 
eral.  Although  it  is  true  that  in  its  typical  occurrence  in  bedrock 
there  is  an  evident  relation  of  the  ore  to  some  igneous  rock  from 
which  the  tin-bearing  solutions  probably  emanated,  cassiterite  may 
also  occur  in quartz veins  and small  dikes  at some  distance  from  any 
large  igneous  mass.  There  is  a  strong likelihood  that the tin  of  the 
placers  has not been  brought  a  great  distance to  its  present  position 
but that it has been derived from veins and dikes  of the country rock 
that  have  been  eroded  from  the  same  area  in  which  the  tin-bearing 
placers  are  found.  Bedrock prospecting in the vicinity  of the mines 
is  difficult,  owing  to the  thick  covering  of  gravel  and  silt.  A  closer 
scrutiny  of  the bedrock  exposed  in the mines  and in the neighboring 
hills  is  desirable,  especially  of the quartz  veins  and  micaceous  dikes, 
which  may  possibly  be  tin  bearing.  Should  any  angular  and  little- 
worn  cassiterite  be  found  in  the  gravels  it would  be  good  evidence 
of a bedrock deposit near at hand.  That the quartz veins of the Sul(cid:173) 
livan  Creek  area  are  probably  the  source  of  the  tin  as  well  as  of  a 
large part of the gold is indicated in the structure of the ore, which is 
in the form  of  a  recemented  breccia.  The  fragments  composing  the 
breccia  are  vein  quartz;  the  cementing  material  is  principally  cas(cid:173) 
siterite.  Blue  and brown tourmaline  and small quantities  of fluorite

286

MINERAL  RESOURCES  OF  ALASKA,  1911.

also  fill  spaces  between  the  quartz  fragments  in  some  of  the  speci(cid:173) 
mens.  From  this  structure  it  is  inferred  that the  quartz  veins  were 
originally formed barren of the other minerals along the joint planes 
of  the  country  rock,  and  that  subsequent  dynamic  stresses  caused 
movement along these  planes and the brecciation of the quartz  veins. 
These stresses were possibly due to the injection beneath the region of 
an  igneous  mass  which  may  have  furnished  the  tin-bearing  emana(cid:173) 
tions  from which  the  ores  were  derived.
