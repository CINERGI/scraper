ABSTRACT

Age dates  from  the  Tower Peak quadrangle  and surrounding area 
demonstrate  that  there was a period of continuous  thermal-plutonic 
activity  from about  100 Ma to 82 Ma,  during which time  four  large 
plutonic  sequences  were emplaced.  This  period began with  the 
emplacement of the Avonelle Lake adamellite,  approximately 100 Ma.  The 
second plutonic event was  the  in emplacement of the  Fremont Lake-Topaz 
Lake plutonic  sequence,  87  Ma to  82  Ma.  The  third plutonic  sequence, 
the Mt.  Gib son-Lake Vernon plutonic sequence,  was emplaced 94 Ma to  87 
Ma.  The  emplacement of  the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite,  87 Ma to  82  Ma, 
concluded  this  period of plutonic  activity.  The  combined K-Ar,  Rb-Sr, 
and U-Pb  age  dates  from  the  Mt.  Gibson-Vernon Lake plutonic  sequence, 
Fremont Lake-Topaz Lake plutonic sequence,  and the  Tuolumne  Intrusive 
Suite  indicate  that  each of  these  large Late Cretaceous plutonic 
sequences was  emplaced over a period of 3-5 m.y.  and  that  the  times  of 
emplacement were partially overlapping.  K-Ar age dates  from older 
plutonic rocks within the Tower Peak quadrangle  indicate  that  the 
thermal  effects  from the  emplacement of these  large plutons  extend at 
least  3  km  into  the  adjacent  country  rock.  The  disparity between 
hornblende and biotite K-Ar cooling ages  indicates  emplacement depths  of 
2-6 km for  the  northern portion of  the  Cathedral  Peak unit of  the 
Tuolumne  Intrusive  Suite  and  6-8 km for  the  Mt.  Gibson-Vernon Lake 
complex.

INTRODUCTION

This  study was  undertaken  to  determine  the  ages  of plutonic rocks 

in  the Tower Peak quadrangle,  which  is  located 175 km southeast of 
Sacramento,  California,  in northern Yosemite National  Park.  The  25 
Mesozoic  intrusive bodies within the  quadrangle are well exposed due  to 
Pleistocene glaciation,  making it  relatively easy to determine intrusive 
relations.  Potassium-argon age dates  for hornblende  and biotite mineral 
pairs have been used  to  determine  the  cooling ages  of various  granitic 
bodies within  the  Tower Peak quadrangle.  This  information was  used  to 
examine  possible  emplacement depths  for  these Late Cretaceous  plutons, 
and to develop a regional  cooling history for  this  portion of  the  Sierra 
Nevada.  Additionally,  K-Ar dates have been used to  delineate episodes 
of plutonic activity within the Tower Peak quadrangle  and adjacent 
areas.

The  Sierra Nevada Batholith  is  part of a continuous  belt of 

Mesozoic granitic plutons  that extends  from Baja California northward 
through  the  Sierra Nevada into  the Klamath Mountains  and  forms an east- 
facing  arc  through  northwestern Nevada,  Idaho,  and back  through 
northeastern Washington  to  southeastern Alaska  (Bateman  et  al.,  1963; 
Schweickert,  1981).  Individual plutons within the Sierra Nevada 
Batholith are dominantly tonalite  to  adamellite  in composition, with 
relatively few small bodies of granite,  alaskite,  diorite,  and gabbro

(Bateman et  al.,  1963).  Intrusive bodies within  the  batholith vary in 
areal  extent  from  less  than 1  km  for  small  stocks  to  greater  than  1000 
km  for  large  composite bodies.

The  Sierra Nevada Batholith intruded Precambrian,  Paleozoic,  and 

early Mesozoic  rocks  (Bateman and Wahrhaftig,  1966;  Dibblee,  1980). 
Most of the plutons were passively emplaced.  Xenoliths of wall rock 
showing all  stages  of assimilation are preserved within some  of the 
plutons  that compose  the batholith,  implying that  stoping and crustal 
assimilation were the principle mechanisms of emplacement (Kistler, 
1966;  Ristler  and  Bateman,  1966;  Kistler,  Evernden,  and Shaw,  1971).

The mountain range known as  the  Sierra Nevada  is  approximately 500 

km  long  and  100  to  130 km wide and cuts  obliquely across  the  Sierra 
Nevada Batholith.  Structurally,  the  Sierra Nevada Range  is  a westward- 
tilted Cenozoic  fault block of Paleozoic and Mesozoic granitic and 
met amor phic  rocks unconformably overlain on its west  flank by unde formed 
uppermost  Cretaceous  and Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks 
(Curtis,  Evernden,  and Lipson,  1958;  Bateman  et  al.,  1963).

Isotopic  age  data  obtained by Evernden and Ristler  (1970),  Stern et 
al.,  (1981),  and  Chen  and Moore  (1982)  on plutons within  the  Sierra 
Nevada indicate  the  following:

1) 

Plutons  range  in  age  from Trias sic  to Late  Cretaceous.

2) 

3) 

A N20W- trending belt of Cretaceous  granitoids was  emp laced 
across  a  belt of Jurassic  granitoids.

The Cretaceous  intrusive sequence becomes progressively
younger  eastward;  the  Jurassic  series  shows  no  such  relation.

Based on K-Ar  and Rb-Sr  dating,  Evernden and Ristler  (1970) 

proposed  that  the  Sierra Nevada Batholith was  emplaced during five 
intrusive epochs,  each  lasting  10  to  20 m.y.  and  separated by  intervals 
of approximately  30  nuy.  U-Pb  ages  reported by  Stern  et  al.,  (1981)  and 
Chen and Moore (1982),  however,  provide only partial  support  for  five 
cyclic  intrusive  epochs.  The U-Pb data  indicate  that:

1) 

2) 

3) 

Plutonism was more or  less  continuous between  210  and  155  m.y. 
ago.

Intrusion of large-volume plutons occurred about  120  to 80 
m.y.  ago.

A hiatus  of  about  35  nuy.  exists  between  the  Triassic-Jurassic 
and  the  Cretaceous  intrusive  periods.

Chen and Moore  (1982)  suggest  that  this hiatus  correlates with  a

change  in  the  regional  stress  field that  is  recorded by  the  Nevadan 
orogeny  and  by  the  intrusion of the  Independence dike  swarm.

GENERAL GEOLOGY OF  THE  TOWER PEAK QUADRANGLE

The rocks  within the Tower Peak quadrangle are principally 

granodiorite and adamellite but range  in  composition  from gabbro  to 
leucogranite.  At  least 25 Mesozoic  intrusive events are represented by 
discrete bodies with sharp vertical  to near-vertical  contacts 
(Wahrhaftig,  written  comm.,  1983).  Tertiary  volcanic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  and Mesozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks  outcrop 
locally.

In  the  Tower  Peak quadrangle,  an L-shaped body of older plutonic 
and metamorphic  rock (JPmvr,  JPmvb,  JTbs,  JÂ¥q,  JTms,  KJdi,  KJgd,  Kal, 
Ktl,  Kpm,  Khl,  Khl a,  Kdl,  Lbp,Ka,  Kult,  Kgm,  and Klc)  forms  a  septum 
between younger Cretaceous  composite plutons  to  the  north,  east,  and 
southwest  (Figure  1).  This  body of older rock,  covering approximately 
300 km2 ,  extends diagonally across  the  quadrangle,  both northeast  and 
southeast.  Some  of  the  plutonic  rocks  within  this  older L-shaped body 
show a metamorphic  foliation and  lineation.  Zones  of  intense  shearing 
are  found  locally within  the  Harriet Lake granodiorite  (Khl),  Dorothy 
Lake  granite  (Kdl),  and Bond Pass  granite  (Kbp).  The  shearing,  best 
developed  in  the  Bond Pass  granite,  trends  approximately NAOW.  The 
shear  texture  is  cut  in  turn by  the  Cathedral  Peak Granodiorite  (Kcp) 
and  Fremont Lake  granodiorite  (Kf),  indicating  that  there was  a period 
of tectonic activity  that  postdates  intrusion of  the Harriet Lake 
granodiorite,  Dorothy Lake  granite,  and Bond Pass  granite  and predates 
intrusion of the  Cathedral  Peak Granodiorite  and Fremont Lake 
granodiorite.

The  oldest rocks  in  the  Tower Peak quadrangle are metasedimentary 

and metavolcanic  rocks  that  occur  as  roof pendants  and  septa.  The 
metasedimentary rocks  include white  orthoquartzite,  thick units  of 
biotite-sillimanite-andalusite schist, crystalline marble, and calc- 
silicate  hornfels  (Wahrhaftig,  written  comm.,  1982).  The  structure  of 
the metasediments  in  the  southwest  corner of  the  quadrangle  is  an 
anticline with  vertical  limbs.  The northern body of metasedimentary 
rocks  show evidence of at  least  two periods of deformation;  isoclinal 
folding followed by deformation into a  flat-topped dome with vertical 
flanks  along  intrusive  contacts  (Wahrhaftig,  written  comm.,  1982). 
These  thick units of metasedimentary rocks  are  lithologically similar to 
and are  tentatively correlated with the Kings  sequence of Bateman  and 
Clark (197A),  and  are,  therefore,  considered Late Triassic  to  Early 
Jurassic  in  age.  If  this  correlation  is  correct,  it  extends  the  known 
occurrence  of  the  Kings  sequence  another AO km northwest.

Metavolcanic  rocks  outcrop  in  the northeast corner of the Tower 

Peak quadrangle near  the West Fork of  the  West Walker River and  in  the 
West Walker River drainage.  This volcanic sequence  is  composed of 
intermediate  to  felsic  flows  and  tuffs.  Fiamme  can be  seen on weathered 
outcrops  of the  metarhyolite,  indicating an ignimbrite protolith 
(Wahrhaftig,  written comm.,  1982).  The  metavolcanic  rocks  within  the 
Tower Peak quadrangle are  lithologicaly similar to and are tentatively 
correlated with  the  lower Ritter Range  sequence of Fiske  and Tobisch 
(1978)  and  are,  therefore,  probably Permian  to  Middle Jurassic  in  age.

A complex of Tertiary volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks rests 

unconformably on Mesozoic  granitic basement  in  the northern part of the 
Tower Peak quadrangle.  The  oldest Tertiary unit  in  the  quadrangle  is  a 
rhyolite  tuff of  the Valley Springs Formation.  Dalrymple (1963,  1964) 
dated a series  of welded tuffs  from the Valley Springs  Formation 
northwest of the  Tower Peak quadrangle  in  the  Sonora Pass  area of the 
Dardanelles Cone  quadrangle,  at  25.7  Ma.  Other  age  dates  from  tuff 
units  of  the  Valley Springs Formation range  from 19.9  to  33.2  Ma 
(Slemmons,  1966).  Overlying the Valley Springs rhyolite  is  a complex of 
andesitic  flows,  dikes,  sills,  and intrusive breccias of the  Mehrten 
Formation.  Dalrymple  (1963,  1964)  reported age  dates  of 8.8  Ma  for  a 
latite  flow within  the  Mehrten Formation northwest of the Tower Peak 
quadrangle  in  the Dardanelles Cone  quadrangle and 8.9  Ma for  a  latite 
flow south of  the  Tower Peak quadrangle  in  the  Hetch Hetchy quadrangle.

METHODS

Samples were  thin-sectioned and  examined under a petrographic 

microscope  to determine  if  the  hornblende  and/or biotite were unaltered 
and  suitable  for  K-Ar  age  dating.  Hornblende and biotite  concentrates 
were  obtained using  standard mineral  separation  techniques  (Appendix  I). 
Mineral  concentrates  of greater  than 99% purity were  then split for 
potassium and  argon  analyses.

Potassium analyses  were  done by  the  flame photometry method using 
lithium  for  an  internal  standard (see  Appendix II).  Samples were put 
into  solution by  fusing the mineral with  lithium metaborate and 
dissolving the  resultant glass  in  nitric  acid.

Argon extractions were  done  at  Stanford University using an 

extraction system recently constructed by  the  author.  Procedures used 
for  the  argon extractions  are  described by Dalrymple and Lanphere 
(1969).  Argon analyses were  done  at  the  University of California, 
Berkeley,  using a Reynolds-type  gas  source mass  spectrometer  in  the 
laboratory of Garniss  Curtis.
