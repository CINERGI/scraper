Thermal Conductivity of Some Rock-Forming Minerals:  A Tabulation

By William H.  Diment and Howard R.  Pratt

INTRODUCTION

This  compilation supplements Robertson's  (1988)  study of the  thermal 
properties  of rocks.  The data were discussed by Diment  (1967)  and a version 
of table  1  circulated about  that  time.  The  table was  subsequently updated to 
1969  and an edited version of that  table is  presented here.  The  table 
contains measurements  from the  literature  as  well  as  those we made  in  the 
laboratory.  Our data are  identified by listing sample  source but no reference 
in  the  "Remarks"  column of  the  table.

Our measurements,  as  well  as  those  in the  literature prior to  1969,  were 
mostly made  on relatively large  samples  (in our case 0.64 x  3.81  cm machined 
disks).  This means  that  in studying monomineralic  aggregates,  we must expect 
some  impurity and some porosity.  However,  information on anisotropy can be 
obtained by cutting  the  disks  in appropriate  directions.  In more  recent 
years,  Horai  and Simmons  (1969)  and Horai  (1971)  used a needle probe  technique 
to  measure  the  conductivity of finely ground samples  of minerals.  Great 
purity of sample  can be  achieved,  but all  information as  to  anisotropy  is 
lost.  Moreover,  questions  remain as  to  the  systematics  of the  orientation of 
small  grains  in  the needle probe cell  and the  correction for  fluid content. 
Comparison between the  disk and needle-probe measurements  is  fairly good,  but 
the  scatter  is  large,  as  might be  expected.

Our  principal  conclusions  remain as  they were circa  1967  (Diment,  1967), 
namely:

1.  Substitution of a heavier cation for a lighter one  in an  isomorphous 
series usually reduces  the  thermal conductivity as  demonstrated by 
measurements  on some  oxides,  silicates,  carbonates,  and sulfates.

2.  A plot of conductivity versus  density suggests  that minerals  of  the  same 

mean atomic weight  increase  in conductivity with density  in a manner 
analogous  to  that noted by Birch  (1960,  1961)  for  the velocity of 
compressional waves,  although the  situation for conductivity  is  more 
complex.

3.  The  sheet  silicates  investigated are  all  anisotropic by a  factor between 5 

and 6  but the principal conductivities differ considerably.  The  true 
micas  exhibit principal  conductivities  of about 2  and 12  meal/cm sec  deg 
C,  perpendicular and parallel respectively to  the plane of perfect 
cleavage.  The  conductivities  can be  somewhat  less  than this,  depending 
on the  amount of iron and layer-bonding imperfections.  For talc  and the 
chlorites,  the perpendicular and parallel  conductivities are  about 4  and 
24 meal/cm sec  deg C.  Measurements  on aggregates  of pyrophyllite  and 
serpentine  suggests  that pyrophyllite belongs with  the  talc-chlorite 
group and that  serpentine  is  closer to  the micas  or  intermediate  in 
conductivity.

4.  The range  in values  obtained for a given mineral,  particularly that for  a 
monomineralic aggregate,  often exceed 10 percent because of  impurities, 
alteration,  imperfection,  and a  small but significant porosity.  Thus, 
most values,  especially those measured at  low pressures,  may be  too 
low.

COMMENTS AFFECTING CALCULATION OF CONDUCTIVITY OF ROCK 

FROM MINERAL COMPOSITION

A few generalizations  regarding the  conductivity of rocks  follow from this  and 
other  studies  cited in the  references:

1.  Foliated rocks  such as  quartz-mica schists,  green schists,  and gneisses 

exhibit a mean anisotropy  (ratio  of conductivity parallel  and 
perpendicular to plane of  foliation)  of about 1.3  (for  example,  Diment 
and Werre,  1964;  Robertson,  1988,  table  2).

2.  The  degree  of alteration of rocks  is  important  in determining their

conductivities.  For example,  ultramafic  rocks  are usually serpentinized 
to  some  degree;  thus,  their conductivities  are  somewhat lower  than would 
be  suspected both because of the  low conductivity of  the  serpentine  and 
its  peripheral  distribution about  the unaltered crystals.  The  amount of 
chlorite  in mafic rocks  is  the most  important variable  in  controlling 
their conductivity.  Unaltered basalts,  diabases,  and gabbro have 
conductivities  of about 5,  whereas  in the  green schist facies  their 
conductivity  is  between 8  and 9  (for example,  Birch,  1954).  As  the 
degree of metamorphism increases  further,  conductivities decrease as  the 
amphiboles  and micas  increase  at  the  expense of the  chlorites.

3.  The  conductivities  of a  surprising number of  igneous  and metamorphic  rocks 

The distribution is  especially peaked when 

fall between 6.5  and 8.5. 
the  average of  the principal conductivities  of  the  foliated rocks  is 
used.  Thus we  suppose  that regional contrast  in  conductivity has  little 
effect on heat  flow,  except  in rather  special  situations.  However, 
local  refraction effects may be sizable where rocks  of anomalous 
conductivities  are present:  the purer quartzites  (12-15),  unaltered 
ultramafic rocks  (^13),  dolomitic marbles  (^12),  anorthosites  and 
unaltered mafic rocks  (^5).

EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS FOR TABLE  1

Sample No.  Assigned sample number  indicates  that measurement was made  in our 

laboratory. 
obtained from literature or  from another  source.  See  Remarks  column.

No  sample number means  that conductivity measurement was 

Mineral.  Chemical  formulae are  generally for pure end members  and are  the

formulae to which the  theoretical densities  (column 7)  correspond.  For 
many samples,  the  chemical  composition is  poorly known.

Conductivity.  Brackets mean that measurement was made on the  same  sample  at 
different temperature,  pressure,  or degree of saturation.  Parentheses 
indicate  that  there  is  some  reason to  suspect the value,  that  is,  a  large 
departure of observed density from theoretical density,  or systematic 
discrepancies  in values  in a given report.The measurements were made  in 
an apparatus  similar  to  that described by Birch  (1950).

Orientation and state.  | 

|  and _|_,  directions  of maximum and minimum

conductivity of a  crystal or an aggregate.  A,  aggregate;  xl,  crystal. 
Occasionally direction is  given with respect to  a  crystal  face.  R and S, 
shelf dried and saturated conditions.  MIX,  determinations  of Horai  and 
Simmons  (1969)  made on mixtures  of crystals  and fluid with values derived 
from the variational bounds.

Porosity.  The porosity was  determined from the  difference  in weight of water- 

saturated sample  (water  immersion under partial vacuum)  and a  dried 
sample  (heated under partial vacuum at 80  °C).

Measured density.  Measured density was  computed from weight and measurement 

of linear dimensions.  Weight used is  room dried or saturated,  depending 
on the  state  given in  "Orientation and state".  A few samples were 
chipped prior to weighing,  thus  density may be low.

Theoretical density.  Data  from Robie,  and others  (1966).  They refer  to 

idealized formula given under  "Mineral".

Temperature.  The  temperature at which the conductivity measurement was made. 

Pressure.  The axial pressure on the  sample.

Remarks.  Wards,  sample  from Wards Natural Science Establishment,  Inc.;  USNM, 
sample  from U.S.  National Museum:  their number follows  in parentheses. 
X-ray,  indicates  that composition was verified by X-ray diffraction. 
Heavy reliance has been placed on Clark's  (1966)  tabulation,  and in some 
cases  the original  sources have not been checked.
