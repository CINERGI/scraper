OF STUDIES ON THE DENSITY

PROPERTIES FOR MAJOR COMPONENTS

Introduction

This  bibliography  supplies an annotated  list  of  references 
pertaining 
the  density  of  solutions  of  importance  in 
geothermal exploration and  energy production.  The  list  has  been 
restricted 
to  those  references  containing  data  on  aqueous 
solutions of  the  following  salts:

to 

HC1
NaCl
KC1
CaCl 2
FeCl 2

H 2S0 4
NaHS04
Na2 S04
KHSO*
K 2 SO A

FeS0 4 
H2 C0 3 
NaHC0 3 
Na 2 co 3
KHC0 3

K 2C0 3
NaOH
KOH
Si02 [aq]

Examples 

are

Other components  in  the  geothermal  waters  are  almost  always 
minor. 
compounds*  fluorides,  and 
bisulfides.  Densities of  these  solutions  have  been  neglected 
because  1)  data  for  these  components  at  temperatures above  100°C 
are  uniformly nonexistent,  and  2)  the  salts  are  present  in  such 
minor  quantities  that  they  will  have  only a  negligible  effect on 
the  overall  physical  properties  of  the  geothermal  water. 
The 
volumetric  properties  of  "sea  water"  and  its concentrates  were 
included  in  the  literature  search. 
Sea  water  is  similar  to 
subsurface  brines  in  that  it  is  dominantly  a  NaCl  brine. 
However, 
water  contains  significant  concentrations  of 
magnesium  and  only  traces  of calcium,  whereas  subsurface  brines
(contain  significant  concentrations  of  calcium  and  only  traces of 
magnesium. 
The  difference  in  the  composition  will  have  a 
significant  effect  on  the  chemical  properties  of  the  brine,  but
(only  a  minor effect  on  the  physical  properties such as  density.

The  period  covered  by  this  report  is  from  1928  to  the 
[present. 
Data  available  prior  to  1928  were  evaluated  and  the 
jresults are  given  in  volume  3  of  the  International  Critical 
ITables  (National  Research  Council,  1928).  The  list  contained 
lere  is  as complete  as  a  diligent  search  of  literature  and 
>ibliographies  would  permit.  With  few  noted exceptions,  copies 
)f  all  articles  were  used  to  prepare the  annotation. 

The  units

of  measurement  cited  in  the  annotation  are  those used  in  the 
reference.  No  conversion  to  the  International  System  of  Units 
(Page  and Vigoureux,  1972) has  been  made because  that  work  would 
reguire  a  substantial  effort,  delay  publication*  and  impair  the 
timeliness of  this bibliography.

An  evaluation of  the  guality  of  the  data  given  in  the  cited 
references  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this report.  The  report  is 
intended  to  supply  the  national  geothermal  effort  with  an 
immediate location  of  unevaluated data  for  use  in  preliminary 
calculations. 
The  report  will  also  serve  as  a  basis  for 
preparing  tables  of  the  densities  of  brines  and  for  planning a 
future  research  effort  on  the  physical  and 
thermochemical 
properties  of  brines.  In  the  section,  Breakdown  of  bibliography 
by  chemical  species,  however,  we  have noted  those  studies  that 
contain  data  for  temperatures  at  and  greater  than  100°C.  Those 
studies containing data  for  pressures greater  than  ambient  (that 
is  for  the  vapor-absent  pressure-temperature region)  are  also 
flagged separately.

The  bibliography  is  a  first step  toward  satisfying the needs 
of  scientists  and engineers as  were  expressed  at  the  Conference 
on  Thermodynamics and National  Energy  Problems (National  Academy 
of  Sciences,  1974)  and  as  further  amplified  by  the  Ad  Hoc 
Committee  on  Geothermal  Chemistry (197<t)  convened by  the  0.  S. 
Support  for  this  work  has  come 
Atomic  Energy  Commission.

Experimental  methods

The  diverse types  of  experimental  methods  and  techniques 
utilized  to  measure  the density  of  a  brine  are  discribed  briefly 
below.  This  description is  not  intended  to  be  a  detailed  or 
exhaustive  treatise  on  how  to  measure  density  and  specific 
volume,  but rather  generally to  inform  the  reader  of the  meaning 
of  various  phrases  that  are  used  in  the  text  of  the  annotations 
to  describe  how  the  particular  set  of  experimental  data  was 
collected. 
Because the precision of  the  individual experimental 
technique  varies widely,  depending  largely  on  the  experimental 
configuration  and  the  investigator,  no  attempt  was  made  in  this 
bibliography to  specify the  precision or  accuracy  of  the  sundry 
methods and  techniques given  below.

The  pycnometer  is  perhaps the  simplest  and  most  commonly 
used  method  for  directly  measuring  the  density of  a  brine  below 
100°C.  The  basic  principle of  the  method  is  to  weigh  a  precisely 
known  volume  of  brine  at  constant  temperature. 
Knowing  the 
volume  and  weight  of  that  volume,  the  density  or  specific  volume
